# vmq_mzbench
An MQTT loadtest and usage scenario tool

vmq_mzbench acts as a benchmark worker for Satori's MZBench. (https://github.com/mzbench/mzbench)

To use vmq_mzbench, you have to do 2 things: 

1. Install and start MZBench
2. Develop scenario files and feed them to MZBench (http://satori-com.github.io/mzbench/scenarios/spec/)

The scenario file will fetch vmq_mzbench.

Preliminary documentation is available here: https://vernemq.com/docs/vmq_mzbench/
